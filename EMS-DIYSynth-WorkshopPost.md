# DIY Synthesiser Workshop

This workshop is a crash-course in creating sound-making electronics!
We're going to use some inexpensive parts to make some
insane, noisy synthesisers and think about some ways to use them in
performances.

- **Date: Friday 10th July 10am-5pm**
- **Location: Big Band Room, Peter Karmel Building, ANU School of Music**
- **Cost: $100 (payment via PayPal or credit/debit card, cash or card
  accepted on the day)**
- **Includes: Tuition and all parts and materials to make a crazy DIY synth!**

We're going to repurpose two common integrated circuits from the
foundations of computing as sound-making oscillators and you'll learn
how to control their pitch and volume with knobs and light-sensors and
make them play nice with other gear like effects pedals and
amplifiers. Each part can be made into _multiple_ oscillator voices leading to
some highly unusual sound possibilities! 

All the materials to create a synthesiser from scratch are provided
including cardboard and plastic containers to make custom enclosures!
You can keep your hackable creations for your next musical experiment!

## Bookings Essential!

This workshop is limited to **10 places** and it won't go ahead until
I have five confirmed! Get in touch by the online form below, and I'll
send you a Paypal invoice for the workshop (payment by credit/debit or
Paypal account). No booking is final until payment is made!
